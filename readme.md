# ðŸ¦€ Rust Learning & Exploration

Welcome to my Rust learning repository!  
This is where I document, experiment with, and explore the Rust programming language â€” from basics to more advanced topics.

## ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

This repo includes:

- ðŸ§  **Notes**: Key concepts, syntax, and patterns
- ðŸ›  **Mini Projects**: Small programs and utilities built while learning
- ðŸ§ª **Experiments**: Trying out features like ownership, lifetimes, traits, etc.
- ðŸ§° **Snippets**: Handy, reusable Rust code blocks
- ðŸ“¦ **Crate Demos**: Playing with popular libraries like `serde`, `tokio`, `clap`, etc.

## ðŸ’¡ Why This Repo Exists

I'm learning Rust because:

- It's systems-level but memory-safe
- It has excellent performance without garbage collection
- The compiler helps you write correct code
- It's increasingly used in real-world production software
